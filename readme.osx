This is an osx version of a forth interpreter written in c, that came 
from usenet postings.  The original documentation is in the file 
cforth.doc.  
I have hacked the code as necessary to get it to compile (more or less) 
cleanly on OSX 10.5.
The program works, but there's still several bugs present in this port.
For one thing, you can't save your environment, and reload it from 
within the forth environment.

There are several other issues (only hex and base 10 are recognized, 
though octal and binary are coded into the files).
Well, binary is in the version I have here, but I broke something in 
adding the binary command, so that version isn't uploaded just yet.
But in any case, this initial version was good enough to get me through 
most of the forth tutorial located at:
http://forth.com/starting-forth/index.html

It was only when the tutorial got into discussing arrays, cells, and 
memory manipulation that this version of forth fell short.
This is one thing I'd like to fix.
I'm hoping to make cforth handle everything the above mentioned tutorial 
talks about and thereby make it a fully usable version of forth.
Since the original version was released into the public domain, seeking 
permission for posting it on sourceforge shouldn't be necessary, and no 
attempt has been done to do so.
However, if anyone knows where he may be found, please feel free to 
point him to this sourceforge page.  I know he said there would be no 
fixes of the code, and that's fine, I'd just like him to know that 
nearly 25 years after his initial release, cforth is still out there.

Another point.
I'm certainly not the world's best C guy, I'd likely be classified as an 
intermediate C programmer (at best) so any comments on code, how to do 
things, patches, and the like are of course all welcome.
I will of course incorporate as many fixes as I can, and of course I'll 
continue working on it myself, and hopefully get some of the issues 
fixed, but until that happens, be advised that there are lots of things 
wrong with this release, and it may not work for you, or it may work 
fine, that's all up to how it's used, and how much you need it to do.

I've included osx intel binaries (I'll have universal binaries in the 
next release) so osx users can run the program right away, and try some 
of the samples from the above mentioned tutorial.
If anyone has any questions, please use the sourceforge forums to bring 
them up, as my email host has a nasty habbit of bouncing emails, because 
it thinks everything under the sun is spam, so don't feel bad about 
posting there, I'll keep an eye on them.
Enjoy.
June 2010.
